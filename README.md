# SudoKu-Solver
Backtracking algorithmic-technique has been used to solve problems recursively.

Backtracking is a technique based on algorithm to solve problem. It uses recursive calling to find the solution by building a solution step by step increasing values with time. It removes the solutions that doesn't give rise to the solution of the problem based on the constraints given to solve the problem.

 Input - A partially filled 9×9 2D array ‘grid[9][9]’.

Goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.
